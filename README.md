# Making a Django Portfolio :shit: :shit: :shit:

### 1. Creating the Django project
In the folder that you wish the create your portfolio execute:
```shell
django-admin startproject portfolio
```
This will create a new directory called `portfolio` which has a subdirectory
with the same name. It is suggested that you rename the parent directory
to something to something such as `portfolio-project` to avoid ambiguity


With `manage.py` in your working directory, run the following command
and navigate to the url that it outputs:

```shell
python3 manage.py runserver
```
